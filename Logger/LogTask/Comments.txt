Comments regarding the task:

	* It took me 3 evenings to finish the task (Starting from Tuesday evening).
	* Fixed bug, changed "List<LogLine>" to "BlockingCollection<LogLine>" for thread-safe operation.
	* Removed "if (!Directory.Exists(@"C:\LogTest"))", because it is not necessary.
	* Every write operation is done with "using" statement (without AutoFlush)
	* Created header string for new log file headers.
	* Created new function for checking if it is new day and creating new file.
	* Fix bug in checking if it is new day (should subtract DateTime.Date, not just DateTime).
	* Implemented more formatting in LogLine object.
	* Not using StringBuilder, because concatenation of small sets of strings are as good as StringBuilder regarding the performance (sometimes even better).
	* Implemented exception catching to prevent LogComponent from blocking a Application.
	* Wrote 3 test in "LoggerTests" class. Every test has passed 10 times.
	* Renamed variables, tidied the code, removed unnecessary "this.", removed unnecessary statements (i.e. "if (f > 5) continue;") and some changes for better readability. 
	
	P.S. Application program writes all numbers to log files and there is no difference if it used "StopWithFlush()" or "StopWithoutFlush()", 
	because after every write call there is "Thread.Sleep" which lets write to finish. You can check different behavior with test method "TestStopBehavior()".
